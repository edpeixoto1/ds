Distributed System Performance Monitor
A Python-based tool that monitors and optimizes the performance of distributed systems by collecting real-time metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, resource utilization) and providing actionable insights. The tool uses AWS for cloud deployment, supports high-throughput data streams, and includes a dashboard for visualization.
Tech Stack: Python, AWS (CloudWatch, S3), Docker, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask (for dashboard), streaming analytics.
Key Features:
Collects real-time performance metrics from distributed nodes.
Analyzes data streams for anomalies and bottlenecks.
Provides actionable insights via a web-based dashboard.
Scales to handle thousands of nodes using cloud infrastructure.
